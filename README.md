# RAGMedicalReportAnalyzer
The Retrieval Augmenter Generator (RAG) Enhanced Medical Report Analyzer project aims to develop an advanced system for automatically analyzing medical reports in PDF format and providing summarized insights while enabling users to ask questions based on the extracted information. 

LLM has the ability to retain contextual information and knowledge over extended passages of text. This feature is used in medical report analysis, where understanding the full context of patient history, treatments, and outcomes is crucial. By leveraging the LLM app, the medical report analyzer can maintain a contextual memory of previous sections of the report, ensuring consistency and coherence in the analysis and summarization process.
